# Apache Airflow Data Scraping and Loading DAG

This repository demonstrates the use of **Apache Airflow** to automate a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, where data is scraped from a website and then loaded into a database. The implementation is done in Python.

## Tools Used
- **Apache Airflow**: An open-source workflow automation tool used to define, schedule, and monitor the ETL pipeline as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
- **Python**: The programming language used for implementing the tasks and connecting them with Airflow operators.
- **Web Scraping Libraries**: (e.g., `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`) used to scrape data from the website.
- **Database**: (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store the scraped data.

## Workflow
1. **Scraping Data**:
   - The first task in the DAG is responsible for scraping data from a website.
   - It uses Python libraries like `Selenium` and `BeautifulSoup` (or any other preferred method) to fetch and parse data from the target website.

2. **Loading Data to Database**:
   - The second task takes the scraped data and loads it into a database.
   - You can configure it to load data into any SQL or NoSQL database like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB.

## DAG Overview
The DAG consists of the following two tasks:
1. **Scrape Website Data**: Scrapes data from a given website using web scraping tools.
2. **Load Data to DB**: Loads the scraped data into a database (you can configure the database connection in the Airflow settings).
